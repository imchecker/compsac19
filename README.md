# Dataset of empirical study on API-Misuse Bugs in Open-Source C Programs
This is a temporary repository for dataset of our empirical study, where we omit all the materials may reveal authors' information for the double-blink review process of [COMPSAC](https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2019/important-dates/)'19. We will publish them as soon as the review process finished!

* API-misuse-patches: patches of API-misuse-fix related commits to summarize root causes of API-misuse bugs in C Projects
* APIMU4C: a API-misuse benchmark of C code to evaluate existing static detectors
* Gitgrabber: to help readers extract the commits message, changed files and patch files, we open source our **Gitgrabber** tool. 

We upload all the original data and evaluation results.
